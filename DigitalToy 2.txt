Elaborate on idea 3 Growing Garden. Specifically discuss what gameJs features and mechanics you are going to build, outline the main components in the gameJs, outline your programming plan on a high level (to modules) to build the gameJs, and list all files for this gameJs for Perlenspiel engine.

Sounds like a good plan. Write the code for each of the file you proposed. Please include no placeholders nor collapses to ensure that they can be runned after direct copy paste.
